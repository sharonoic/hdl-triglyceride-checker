# hdl-triglyceride-checker
This interactive tool calculates your triglyceride-to-HDL cholesterol ratioâ€”a key indicator of metabolic health and cardiovascular risk. Inspired by Dr. Paul Mason's insights on the significance of this ratio, the app allows users to input their lipid values in either mmol/L or mg/dL. It then performs the necessary conversions and provides a clear interpretation of the results.
## Features
- Accepts inputs in both mmol/L and mg/dL units
- Automatically converts values to mg/dL for accurate ratio calculation
- Provides immediate feedback on whether your ratio is ideal, acceptable, or needs attention
- Built with Python and Streamlit for a seamless user experience
