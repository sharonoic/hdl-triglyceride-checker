This interactive tool calculates your triglyceride-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, a key indicator of metabolic health and cardiovascular risk. Inspired by Dr. Paul Mason's insights on the significance of this ratio, the app allows users to input their lipid values in either mmol/L or mg/dL. It then performs the necessary conversions and provides a clear interpretation of the results.
## Features
- Accepts inputs in both mmol/L and mg/dL units
- Automatically converts values to mg/dL for accurate ratio calculation
- Provides immediate feedback on whether your ratio is ideal, acceptable, or needs attention

## About the Ratio
The triglyceride-to-HDL ratio is a simple but powerful indicator of your metabolic and cardiovascular health. It is calculated by dividing your triglyceride level by your HDL cholesterol level. A lower ratio is generally considered better, as it suggests a healthier balance of fats in your blood and may indicate lower risk for heart disease and insulin resistance. Typically, a ratio below 1.5 is considered ideal, between 1.5 and 2 is acceptable, and anything above 2 may point to potential metabolic concerns. This ratio is especially useful for identifying early signs of metabolic syndrome, even in people whose total cholesterol appears normal. The importance of this ratio has been emphasized by experts such as Dr. Paul Mason, who explains how it can reveal more about your health than standard cholesterol tests.
